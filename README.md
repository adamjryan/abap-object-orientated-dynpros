# Object Orientated Dynpro (Screen) Framework

  * Allows the construction of a more completly object orientated program / report and dynamic screens. 
  * Developed on SAP 4.7 (620), has been tested to work on SAP 720 also. 
  
A slightly experimental framework with influences from the Java Swing library here for anyone who may find an interest in it or even a use!

The files are in NUGG format for import into a SAP system using the NUGG import program.

Feel free to raise any questions on it and I'll do my best to revive my distant memory of ABAP!
